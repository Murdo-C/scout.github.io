            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 18 January, 2025</p>
        
            <p>Welcome to Scout Reader! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our application (the "App"). By using Scout Reader, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>
        
            <h2>1. Overview of the App</h2>
            <p>Scout Reader is a reader-only application that allows users to view content from third-party services, specifically Warpcast. The App does not host, create, or modify any content and does not permit user-generated content or interaction. Users select third-party feeds to follow, and all displayed content is sourced from these external services.</p>
